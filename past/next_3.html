<h1> UPMEM DPU, architecture of the first commercially available PIM system</h1>           
<h2> Fabrice Devaux, UPmem </h2>


<h3> Abstract </h3>
<p id="para" style=" text-align: justify">
<img src="figures/FabriceDevaux.png" alt="Fabrice Devaux" style="float:right; width:200px; margin: 10px 10px 15px 15px;"></img>
In this talk, we will present UPMEM PIM-DRAM, a disruptive, efficient, and scalable Processing In-Memory engine that will significantly contribute to this progress, covering most needs for upcoming digital intelligence and service, 
unleashing the horizon and impact of application developers. We will have a look into the architecture of UPMEM DPU, its supported programming paradigms and spme examples of application benefiting from UPMEM DPU and their achieved speed-up.
We then delve deeper into different aspects of logic on DRAM and close by presenting a perspective on what is likely and feasible to implement on DRAM (and what is not!), as well as the challenges of integrating a PIM memory into a legacy system.

<h3> Biography </h3>
<p id="para" style=" text-align: justify">

Fabrice Devaux is the CTO and a co-founder of UPMEM, a fabless semiconductor company based in Grenoble, France. UPMEM is a leading company in Processor-in-Memory technologies. Before co-founding UPMEM in 2015 (based on a project that began
in 2013), he was in Trango Virtual Processor, an embedded Hupervisor company that he founded in 2003 and sold to VMWARE in 2008. From 1993-2003 he worked as an ASIC designer, micro-architect, and architect at various companies.

Izzat El Hajj is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the American University of Beirut. He received his M.S. and Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2018. 
Prior to that, he received his B.E. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the American University of Beirut in 2011. His research interests are in application acceleration and programming support for emerging accelerators and memories, 
with a particular interest in GPUs and processing-in-memory. Most recently, he developed the compiler for PUMA and PANTHER, which are memristor-based processing-in-memory accelerators for machine learning, and 
he also participated in the development of PrIM, a benchmark suite for general purpose processing-in-memory architectures.
