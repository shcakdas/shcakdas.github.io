<h1> Deep learning acceleration: A killer application for in-memory computing?</h1>           
<h2> Dr. Abu Sebastian, IBM </h2>


<h3> Abstract </h3>
<p id="para" style=" text-align: justify">
<img src="figures/Abu_IEEE.png" alt="Abu Sebastian" style="float:right; width:200px; margin: 10px 10px 15px 15px;"></img>
The rise of AI and in particular, deep learning (DL), is a key driver for innovations in computing systems. There is a significant effort towards the design of custom ASICs based on reduced precision arithmetic and highly optimized dataflow. However, the need to shuttle millions of synaptic weight values between the memory and processing units, remains unaddressed. In-memory computing (IMC) is an emerging computing paradigm that addresses this challenge of processor-memory dichotomy. Attributes such as synaptic efficacy and plasticity can be implemented in place by exploiting the physical attributes of memory devices such as phase-change memory (PCM). In this talk, I will give a status update on where in-memory computing stands with respect to DL acceleration. How do we tackle imprecision arising from noisy, analog computing? I will present some recent algorithmic as well as device-level innovations. I will also touch upon some system-level aspects and will present a world’s first IMC compute core based on PCM fabricated in 14nm CMOS technology. Finally, I will provide a brief overview of photonic in-memory computing that could facilitate unprecedented latency and compute density.

<h2> Dr. Adnan Mehonic </h2>
<h3> University College London </h3>

<img src="figures/a_mehonic.jpg" alt="Adnan Mehonic" style="float:right; width:110px; margin: 10px 10px 15px 15px;"></img>
Adnan Mehonic is currently working on the development of energy-efficient computing systems based on memristors. 
He is interested in non-von Neumann computing paradigms where the physics of memristive devices is harnessed to perform both memory and computing. 
Dr. Mehonic os looking for ways to increase on-device processing by developing application-specific systems with the holistic approach (materials->devices->circuits->algorithms->applications) 
and considering non-conventional methods for information processing (e.g. spike-based computing).

To date, he has authored more than 100 journal publications and international conference proceedings (including more than ten invited talks). 
He is the inventor of 10 resistance-switching patents and co-funder of a spinout company (“IntrinSic Semiconductor Technology”), where I serve as a Chief Technology Officer. 
I received the “One to Watch 2015” award from UCL Enterprise for UCL’s most innovative staff.
