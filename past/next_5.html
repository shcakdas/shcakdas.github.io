<h1> In-Memory Computing with Imperfect or Unreliable Memory Devices</h1>           
<h2> Dr. Damien Querlioz,Université Paris-Saclay </h2>


<h3> Abstract </h3>
<p id="para" style=" text-align: justify">
The emergence of novel memories, such as memristors or resistive memory (RRAM), opens the way to highly energy-efficient computation, near- or in-memory. However, this type of computation has to deal with the severe unreliability of these new memories. Conventionally, the industry uses formal error correction codes (ECC) to eliminate the errors of imperfect devices. However, using ECC would ruin most of the benefits of in-memory computation.  In this talk, I will present several approaches to compute in-memory with unreliable devices and without ECC, going from relatively conventional approaches to radical ideas exploiting device imperfections. First, I will present a manufactured differential CMOS/RRAM memory architecture, inspired by the architecture of animal brains, and suitable for neural network implementation without formal ECC. Measurements on this array highlight that using highly error-prone programming conditions may only slightly reduce network accuracy while bringing important benefits in terms of energy efficiency. Second, I will present an approach where the variability of memristors, instead of being mitigated, can be fully exploited to implement a type of probabilistic learning. The inherent variability of memristors can naturally implement the sampling step in the Metropolis-Hastings Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm. We have, for example, trained an array of 16,384 memristors experimentally to recognize images of cancerous tissues using this technique. These results highlight the interest in fully embracing the unreliable nature of emerging devices in neuromorphic designs.

Damien Querlioz is a CNRS Researcher at the Centre de Nanosciences et de Nanotechnologies of Université Paris-Saclay. His research focuses on novel usages of emerging non-volatile memory and other nanodevices, in particular relying on inspirations from biology and machine learning. He received his predoctoral education at Ecole Normale Supérieure, Paris and his PhD from Université Paris-Sud in 2009. Before his appointment at CNRS, he was a Postdoctoral Scholar at Stanford University and at the Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique. Damien Querlioz is the coordinator of the interdisciplinary INTEGNANO research group, with colleagues working on all aspects of nanodevice physics and technology, from materials to systems. He is a member of the bureau of the French Biocomp research network. He has co-authored one book, nine book chapters, more than 100 journal articles, and conference proceedings, and given more than 50 invited talks at national and international workshops and conferences. In 2016, he was the recipient of an ERC Starting Grant to develop the concept of natively intelligent memory. In 2017, he received the CNRS Bronze medal. He has also been a co-recipient of the 2017 IEEE Guillemin-Cauer Best Paper Award and of the 2018 IEEE Biomedical Circuits and Systems Best Paper Award.
