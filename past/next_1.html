<h1> Intelligent Architectures for Intelligent Machines </h1>           
<h2> Professor Onur Mutlu, ETH Zurich </h2>


<h3> Abstract </h3>
<p id="para" style=" text-align: justify">
Computing is bottlenecked by data. Large amounts of application data
overwhelm storage capability, communication capability, and
computation capability of the modern machines we design today. As a
result, many key applications' performance, efficiency and scalability
are bottlenecked by data movement. We describe three major
shortcomings of modern architectures in terms of 1) dealing with data,
2) taking advantage of the vast amounts of data, and 3) exploiting
different semantic properties of application data. We argue that an
intelligent architecture should be designed to handle data well. We
show that handling data well requires designing architectures based on
three key principles: 1) data-centric, 2) data-driven, 3)
data-aware. We give several examples for how to exploit each of these
principles to design a much more efficient and high performance
computing system. We will especially discuss recent research that aims
to fundamentally reduce memory latency and energy, and practically
enable computation close to data, with at least two promising novel
directions: 1) performing massively-parallel bulk operations in memory
by exploiting the analog operational properties of memory, with
low-cost changes, 2) exploiting the logic layer in 3D-stacked memory
technology in various ways to accelerate important data-intensive
applications. We discuss how to enable adoption of such fundamentally
more intelligent architectures, which we believe are key to
efficiency, performance, and sustainability. We conclude with some
guiding principles for future computing architecture and system
designs.

Onur Mutlu is a Professor of Computer Science at ETH Zurich. He is
also a faculty member at Carnegie Mellon University, where he
previously held the Strecker Early Career Professorship.  His current
broader research interests are in computer architecture, systems,
hardware security, and bioinformatics. A variety of techniques he,
along with his group and collaborators, has invented over the years
have influenced industry and have been employed in commercial
microprocessors and memory/storage systems. He obtained his PhD and MS
in ECE from the University of Texas at Austin and BS degrees in
Computer Engineering and Psychology from the University of Michigan,
Ann Arbor. He started the Computer Architecture Group at Microsoft
Research (2006-2009), and held various product and research positions
at Intel Corporation, Advanced Micro Devices, VMware, and Google.  He
received the IEEE High Performance Computer Architecture Test of Time
Award, the IEEE Computer Society Edward J. McCluskey Technical
Achievement Award, ACM SIGARCH Maurice Wilkes Award, the inaugural
IEEE Computer Society Young Computer Architect Award, the inaugural
Intel Early Career Faculty Award, US National Science Foundation
CAREER Award, Carnegie Mellon University Ladd Research Award, faculty
partnership awards from various companies, and a healthy number of
best paper or "Top Pick" paper recognitions at various computer
systems, architecture, and security venues. He is an ACM Fellow "for
contributions to computer architecture research, especially in memory
systems", IEEE Fellow for "contributions to computer architecture
research and practice", and an elected member of the Academy of Europe
(Academia Europaea). His computer architecture and digital logic
design course lectures and materials are freely available on YouTube
(https://www.youtube.com/OnurMutluLectures), and his research group
makes a wide variety of software and hardware artifacts freely
available online (https://safari.ethz.ch/). For more information,
