                AI and many other applications have opportunities to build systems that merge memory and computing into a unified structure in ways that yields significant improvements in energy efficiency, performance, and cost. In these scenarios, "moving the compute to the memory" makes sense because the applications have large amounts of data to process and relatively simple operations to perform, which makes it not too difficult to create specialized processing near the memory when traditionally moving the data to the main system processor would be slow and inefficient. These approaches have a wide variety of applications as well as approaches. On one end of the spectrum, systems that have processing inside of an SSD to perform searches inside the drive itself, and on the other end of the spectrum, systems that have analog compute performing mathematics directly on the bitlines of the memory arrays. In this talk, we will provide an overview of many of these approaches as well as the methods to their madness.</p>

                Dave Fick co-founded Mythic with Mike Henry in 2012, a company building next-generation intelligence processing units (IPUs) for edge and cloud inference. Mythic has raised $165M of venture capital to combine analog computing, dataflow architecture, and compute-in-memory to provide the best combination of performance and energy efficiency available. Dave received his Ph.D. from the University of Michigan under David Blaauw and Dennis Sylvester at the Michigan Integrated Circuits Lab.

                Stephan Menzel received his PhD degree (summa cum laude) from the RWTH Aachen University in 2012. Since 2012, he has been at the Peter Gr√ºnberg Institut (PGI-7) at Forschungszentrum Juelich GmbH as senior scienticst. He is now the head of the simulation group at the PGI-7, Forschungszentrum Juelich. His group developed simulation tools for resistive switching devices which are commonly available (www.emrl.de/Jart.html). He is associate editor of Scientific Reports (2015-), editor of MDPI Materials (2020-), editor of IEEE Journal of the Electron Device Society (2020-), and Frontiers in Neuroscience (2021-). He is member of the IEEE since 2012 and member of the EDS and CAS society. 
                <br>
                His research interests include the physics, characterization, modeling, and simulation of resistive switching (memristive) devices and computing-in-memory and neuromorphic computing circuits exploiting memristive devices. Stephan Menzel co-authored overall more than 100 papers counting more than 2,500 citations, 8 book chapters and gave 25 invited talks.
